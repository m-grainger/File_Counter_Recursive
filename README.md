# File_Counter_Recursive
A small application to count the number of files in top-level directories.  


To use it, just drop the file in the folder that you want to scan, and run the application via command line.
After scanning is complete, a text file named "counts.txt" is displayed.

I am using this for quicker file counts for massive directories, as this program is quite a bit faster than running "dir" from your CLI.
